## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- A PostgreSQL database (you can get a free one from [Supabase](https://supabase.com/))

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Yonko-Kunal/Issue-Tracker.git](https://github.com/Yonko-Kunal/Issue-Tracker.git)
    cd Issue-Tracker
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    - Open the `.env` file and add your PostgreSQL connection strings for `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL`. You can get these from your database provider (e.g., Supabase).

4.  **Sync the database schema:**
    - Push the Prisma schema to your database. This will create the `Task` table.
        ```bash
        npx prisma db push
        ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## API Endpoints

The application exposes the following RESTful API endpoints:

| Method   | Endpoint                | Description                     |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/api/tasks`            | Fetches all tasks               |
| `POST`   | `/api/tasks`            | Creates a new task              |
| `PUT`    | `/api/tasks/[id]`       | Updates an existing task        |
| `DELETE` | `/api/tasks/[id]`       | Deletes a task by its ID        |

## Upcoming Features

This project is a solid foundation. Future enhancements could include:
- **User Authentication**: Implement user sign-up and login using NextAuth.js or Clerk.
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Secure the database to ensure users can only access their own tasks.
- **Task Filtering & Sorting**: Add controls to filter tasks by title or sort them by creation date.
